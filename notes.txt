koelewijn_2010
  - C: Cites many articles establishing the background of learning, and computer learning specifically (p5)
  - C: Is very similar to the van Thiel paper
  - C: Tests the user’s reaction time right away to determine baseline reaction time value individually
  - C: Also uses the median of all initial trials as an indicator of the initial alpha value, rather than setting a fixed alpha (p13), but has middling results (p33).
  - C: Compares directly with the van Thiel paper
  - C: Contains both laboratory and real-world experiments and results
  - C: In addition to using initial tested reaction time, base reaction time value (f) can also be optimized for by finding the greatest standard deviation of activation (alpha). (p21)
  - C: Warns about overlearning (p36)
