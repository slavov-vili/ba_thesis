0. Abstract
    - investigates effects of practice and spacing on retention of Japanese-English vocabulary pairs
    - takes into account rate of decay
    - compared to the Raaijmakers_2003 model
1. Introduction
    - practice and forgetting
    - how does repetition improve recall
    - how does increased temporal spacing improve recall
    - how does increased retention interval improve recall
    - explains Contextual Fluctuation Theory (Raaijmakers' theory):
        * practice   = encoding data with context
        * forgetting = fluctuation in context
        * spacing    = prevents overlap
    - suggests Wickens_1999 for important parts of forgetting function
    - rate of forgetting decreases with time
2. Experiment
    - deduced that forgetting is slower after a series of spaced presentations
    - deduced that effects of spacing are greater when there are more practice trials
4. Discussion of model and theory
    - mentions Anderson_Schooler_1991, because attempts to extend ACT-R (Adaptive Character of Thought-Rational) to include spacing effect
5. General discussion
    - wide spacing of practice beneficial with more practice
    - people forget less when presentation is spaced
    - extends ACT-R activation by adding decay



anderson_schooler_1991
1. Instroduction
    - aim to see if memory performs well when retrieving past information
    - examine availability of memory given past use (how often, how long ago, etc.)
    - examine probability that sth is needed given past use (how often, how long ago, etc.)
7. Environmental Explanation
    - no successful mechanistic explanations for practice, retention and the spacing effect
    - need probability, because memories vary in when they are most needed
    - the memory system tries to only get the most needed memories
15. Summary and Conclusions
    - sets the basic formula for studying which takes into account the spacing effect

0. Abstract
    - how to schedule practice to maximize learning and retention
1. Introduction
    - spacing is important to take into account when learning
    - too wide spacing can result in slower learning, because of forgetting
    - discusses a modeling approach which supposedly tries to create or adjust a practice schedule
2. Atkinson's experiment
    - he says that once a pair has been learned, it cannot be forgotten
4. The Experiment
    - mentions Pavlik_2007 when comparing conditions with maximal spacing
5. Experiment Design
    - describes the three algorithms which were tested
10. Results and Discussion
    - turns out item betas don't affect learning that much
12. General discussion
    - still unknwon how much spacing is best



Pavlik_2007
0. Abstract
    - tries to apply test and study practice in order to improve learning
1. Introduction
    - pavlik_anderson_2005 expanded the ACT-R model to take into account spacing, but did not account for the difference between study practice and test practice
    - studying and testing both contribute to learning, but what are the differences ?
    - amount of learning is unrelated to the time it takes to recall
    - two spaced out study sessions are better than one long one
    - is one type of studying better because it provides better encoding or because it prevents forgetting ?
4. Memory model
    - ACT-R captures the recency and frequency effects (stuff is better remember the more recently/frequently it is encountered)
    - the pavlik_anderson_2005 model extends ACT-R to take into account spacing, but does not distinguish between study and test practice nor does it take into account the duration of the study session
6. General discussion
    - failed test trials do not contribute to learning
    - forgetting rate for new learning is controlled by interaction with prior learning
