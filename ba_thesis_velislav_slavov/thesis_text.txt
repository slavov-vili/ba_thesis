1. Introduction
    Technology has made its way into our working environments, vehicles, mobile phones and even into our homes, in an attempt to make our lives easier and more convenient. One area of our lives, where technology has been gaining popularity is education. Educational technology in particular has been gaining increasing popularity due to its efforts in improving the application of technology in facilitating learning.
    Learning words in languages = very important, declarative memory? A language user's mothertongue is learned at a very young age when not much conscious effort is put into the learning process, but instead the learner acquires the language unconsciously therefore that is referred to as "language acquisition". On the other hand when it comes to learning further foreign languages, the user has to actively participate in the learning process in which case we speak of "language learning".
    Cognitive psychology has been able to identify a number of patterns, called cognitive biases, which try to explain how humans process information, such as the modality effect, the testing effect and the spacing effect. While being aware of these patterns allows educators to simply develop systems, which reliably produce improved learning results, computers require well defined and formalized rules in order to achieve this. One of the more famous and successful cognitive architectures is the Adaptive Control of Thoughtâ€”Rational (known as ACT-R).
    The goal of this thesis is to analyze an activation-based learning model, based on the ACT-R architecture and try to develop a more computationally efficient implementation of that model. I will compare the perforamnce as well as the accuracy of the resulting implementation to the original implementation of the model.
