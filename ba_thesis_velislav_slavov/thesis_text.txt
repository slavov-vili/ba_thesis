1. Introduction
    The rapid advancement of technology has enabled it to make its way into our working environments, vehicles, mobile phones and even into our homes, in an attempt to make our lives easier and more convenient. Educational technology in particular studies the application of technology in facilitating learning {Reference Robinson, Rhonda; Molenda, Michael; Rezabek, Landra. "Facilitating Learning"}.
    Whatever we are trying to learn, there are always base units which need to be . In the case of language learning those units are words. A language user's mothertongue is learned at a very young age when not much conscious effort is put into the learning process, but instead the learner acquires the language unconsciously therefore that is referred to as "language acquisition". On the other hand when it comes to learning further foreign languages, the user has to actively participate in the learning process in which case we speak of "language learning".
    Cognitive psychology has been able to identify a number of patterns, called cognitive biases, which try to explain how humans process information, such as the modality effect, the testing effect and the spacing effect. While being aware of these patterns allows educators to simply develop systems, which reliably produce improved learning results, computers require well defined and formalized rules in order to achieve this. One of the more famous and successful cognitive architectures is the Adaptive Control of Thoughtâ€”Rational (known as ACT-R).
    The goal of this thesis is to analyze an activation-based learning model, based on the ACT-R architecture and try to develop a more computationally efficient implementation of that model. I will compare the perforamnce as well as the accuracy of the resulting implementation to the original implementation of the model.
