# Cannot remove unnecessary computations from algorithm



# How well can we approximate development of m without online syncing



# Complexity analysis - chapter of thesis
  - Original complexity, caching complexity
  - Algorithmic improvements



# Improvements

  - Don't change alpha, use cached values when calculating m next time

  - Use same alpha throughout whole session

  - After session check how much end activation diverges from reality (by syncing with server) and adjust alpha

  - compare results of regular calculation and new model (for the whole session and maybe for every step of the computations)



MAYBE: compare alpha change each step during session vs average

MAYBE: rank comparison, how often does change affect the ranks of next words

MAYBE: check how much (quantity) activation history actually makes a difference

MAYBE: cluster items into buckets of alphas
