NEXT MEETING: 26.06 15:00



- Had problems with alpha update, fixed them (kinda)
  Does alpha adjustment make sense ?
- Tested post-session vs after encounter alpha update
  Post-session sucked
  - Tested after encounter without cache vs with cache + cache updating
  - Performed quite well, cache performs a lot faster
  - Results are around the same, but idk how much is due to chance
  - Want to conduct more tests with more/longer sessions



TODO: limit number of items to see if fixes alpha
