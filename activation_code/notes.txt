find best average learning sesh count (relatively accurate and also doesn't take too much time)
best average = 50

    - WITHOUT cache update
        tested immediate vs post-session alpha adjustment (as well as different adjustment values)
        - immediate adjustment by 0.03 wins, but avg alpha error is 0.036
          * tested for 0.02 and 0.04, 0.02 performs quit a bit better (by 0,03)
        - post-session adjustment performed quite bad
        
    - WITH cache update
        tested immediate vs post-session ALPHA adjustment
        - immediate adjustment by 0.03 wins, but avg alpha error is 0.036
          * tested for 0.02 and 0.04, 0.02 performs quit a bit better (by 0,03)
        - post-session adjustment performed quite bad

        tested immediate vs post-session cache update
        - post-session update performed the best


        after best adjustment is found, test different study_sesh_counts and different study_sesh_lengths
