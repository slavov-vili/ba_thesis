TODO: Read through papers and find what they say about best number of words given study time
    - van Thiel says:
      : Pavlik and Anderson: 180 Japanese-English word pairs, 3 sessions, 1 hour each, days 1, 3, 5
      : van Woudenberg: 20 French-Dutch word pairs, 1 session, 15 minutes
      : van Thiel: 20 French-Dutch word pairs (in batches), 1 session, 15 minutes
    - van Woundenberg says:
      : most research = > 30min study and > 1week retention; student's usually < 30min study and 1day retention
      : van Woundenberg: 20 French-Dutch word pairs (in batches), 1 session, 15 minutes
      : Most research just does learning and test at the end
      : Dynamic learning increses success by up to 10%, below average students score significantly higher
      : Q: Best item count given a set study time?
        A: Item count depends on performance of user.
      : Q: Best study time given item count?
        A: Study time depends on the reaction (and response) of the user.
      : Alpha adjustment by 0.01
    - Koelewijn says:
      : Koelewijn: 15 English-Dutch word pairs, 2 study sessions, 15 minutes each (twice + test on everything at the end)
    - Nijboer says:
      : Nijboer: 72 Biological facts, 4 sessions (3 study, 1 test), 25 minutes each (1 session = 24 facts, 2 = 48, 3 = 72)
      : about 19/63 had >55%, for flashcards it was 12/63


TODO: Redo all tests with latest implementation
    - Tests redone, results - saved

TODO: Test different session counts and lengths with alpha adjust = 0.02

TODO: Copy Chris' results and calculate average alpha difference

TODO: Find out best session count/length combination when have 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week

TODO: Redo session count tests with 0.01

TODO: Clean up latest implementation

TODO: Update graph file with latest implementation



TODO: Compare real item order vs model's

find best average learning sesh count (relatively accurate and also doesn't take too much time)
best average = 50

    - WITHOUT cache update
        tested immediate vs post-session alpha adjustment (as well as different adjustment values)
        - immediate adjustment by 0.03 wins, but avg alpha error is 0.036
          * tested for 0.02 and 0.04, 0.02 performs quit a bit better (by 0,03)
        - post-session adjustment performed quite bad
        
    - WITH cache update
        tested immediate vs post-session ALPHA adjustment
        - immediate adjustment by 0.03 wins, but avg alpha error is 0.036
          * tested for 0.02 and 0.04, 0.02 performs quit a bit better (by 0,03)
        - post-session adjustment performed quite bad

        tested immediate vs post-session cache update
        - post-session update performed the best


        after best adjustment is found, test different study_sesh_counts and different study_sesh_lengths
