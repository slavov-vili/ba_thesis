recalculate history for 1 item (the one whose alpha was changed)

recalculate whole history after session





TODO: update graph file
TODO: run below tests again after history update is implemented

find best average learning sesh count (relatively accurate and also doesn't take too much time)
best average = 50

    after best average is found, test immediate vs post-session alpha adjustment (as well as different adjustment values)
    - immediate adjustment by 0.03 wins
      * tested for 0.02 and 0.04, they were worse, 0.02 was 0.001 off so its also a possible choice
    - post-session adjustment by 0.05 also performed well
      * tested for 0.04 and 0.06, 0.06 was better than 0.05
        
        after best adjustment is found, test them while upating the history

        after best adjustment is found, test different study_sesh_counts and different study_sesh_lengths
