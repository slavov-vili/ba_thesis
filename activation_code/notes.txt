TODO: Read through papers and find what they say about best number of words given study time
    - van Thiel says:
      : Pavlik and Anderson: 180 Japanese-English word pairs, 3 sessions, 1 hour each, days 1, 3, 5
      : van Woudenberg: 20 French-Dutch word pairs, 1 session, 15 minutes
      : van Thiel: 20 French-Dutch word pairs (in batches), 1 session, 15 minutes
    - van Woundenberg says:
      : most research = > 30min study and > 1week retention; student's usually < 30min study and 1day retention
      : van Woundenberg: 20 French-Dutch word pairs (in batches), 1 session, 15 minutes
      : Most research just does learning and test at the end
      : Dynamic learning increses success by up to 10%, below average students score significantly higher
      : Q: Best item count given a set study time?
        A: Item count depends on performance of user.
      : Q: Best study time given item count?
        A: Study time depends on the reaction (and response) of the user.
      : Alpha adjustment by 0.01
    - Koelewijn says:
      : Koelewijn: 15 English-Dutch word pairs, 2 study sessions, 15 minutes each (twice + test on everything at the end)
    - Nijboer says:
      : Nijboer: 72 Biological facts, 4 sessions (3 study, 1 test), 25 minutes each (1 session = 24 facts, 2 = 48, 3 = 72)
      : about 19/63 had >55%, for flashcards it was 12/63


TODO: Redo all tests with latest implementation
    - Tests redone, results - saved

TODO: Do tests with adjustment = 0.02 and sesh_count = 4, 5, 7, 10
    - Done, 7 sessions wins by a very slight lead, so 4 is good enough

TODO: Clean up latest implementation

TODO: Update graph file with latest implementation


TODO: Compare real item order vs model's
