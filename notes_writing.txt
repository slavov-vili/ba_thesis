1. Chapter explaining the algorithm

2. Chapter about optimization
    - optimizing the algorithm itself
    - caching to relieve recursive calls
    - using cached history when next item is needed
    - like ^, but updating history after session
    - updating alpha after encounter vs after session
    - how much to adjust alpha by if adjusted after session
    - how above things work with more sessions and session lengths
