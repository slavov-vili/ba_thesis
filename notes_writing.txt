1. Chapter explaining the algorithm

2. Chapter about optimization
    - optimizing the algorithm itself
    - caching to relieve recursive calls
    - my implementation is different than Chris', so I had to figure out alpha adjustment (most papers say 0.5, but I tested and scaled by recall probability (according to the model))
    - updating alpha after encounter vs after session (tested average alpha error, duration, item encounters)
        - For ^ after session, get % correct vs incorrect outcomes, take average recall probability to calculate
        - using cached history when next item is needed (tested average duration)
            - like ^, but updating history after session ()
    - how does ^ perform with more/longer sessions
